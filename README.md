# Joy!

Joy is a Valheim mod using [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) and [BepinEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/) and aimed at improving the joypad/controller experience.

## Joy adds the following gamepad functionality

### Fly mode
* Hold the joy alternate button (usually L2) and press sit (usually X/square) to enter/exit fly/creative mode.
* When in fly mode press jump (usually B/circle) to fly up and sit or crouch (usually L3) to fly down.
* Uses a suped-up fly mode from [Valheim Quality of Life](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/QoLTeam/QualityOfLife/) that preserves your stamina and food, removes the carry limit and allows you to build anything for free. 
* Integrates with Valheim Quality of Life if present.

### Emotes
* Hold both L1 and L2 or both R1 and R2 then press up, down, left or right on the D-pad, A, B, X, Y, L3 or R3 to access 19 different emotes.

### Map
* When the map is expanded, the selected pin radius is increased so you don't need to be as accurate when selecting an existing pin.
* The selected pin is also highlighted so you can see which one you're getting. 
* The pin highlighting/mouseover state is an essential UI enhancement and a curiously missing feature from the base game and so also works for mouse.
* Integrates with [TargetPortal](https://github.com/snorkyware/TargetPortal) if present.

## Installation
1. First make sure [BepinEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) is installed.
2. Download the Joy zip file and extract Joy.dll into your BepInEx\plugins directory.
3. Go forth and conquer Valheim, Joypad Vikings!
